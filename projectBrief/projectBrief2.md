# DJS04 Project Brief: Book Connect - Web Components

Building upon your "Book Connect" project in DJS03, you will now dive into Web Components. This challenge will refine your skills in creating reusable, encapsulated, and interactive elements.

NOTE Here you are to continue where you left off in DJS03. This means you must build on your abstractions and work on transforming the Book Preview functionality into a web component
